# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

This was a challenge I took in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) for practicing purposes. Feel free to learn from the code.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I first started off adding the color variables and looking at the style guide to see the colors needed. I then proceeded to make the card with flex and centered it. I was able to do everything aside from the hover states, so I did that last. I needed to do research in order to replicate the view icon hover effect so I did that and was able to finish the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Love

### What I have learned

I learned more about Git because I was having merge issues, and I learned more about Flexbox and as well as variables and horizontal rules. Image inner border was also something I learned while doing this challenge. Overall, I've learned lots of valuable info on this challenge. :)

### Continued development

I really want to improve in Flexbox and Grid because those are the things I am lacking, but I am starting to get comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow post 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151743/how-can-i-change-the-thickness-of-my-hr-tag) - This resource helped me find out how to size horizontal rule tags, and it also helped me to color it as well.
- [Stackoverflow post 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19159977/inner-border-over-images-with-css) - This is the post that helped me put an inner border in the avatar. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Stackoverflow post 3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6910049/on-a-css-hover-event-can-i-change-another-divs-styling) - This helped me do the hover effect on the equilibrium icon. It was a very helpful resource and I was able to show the view or eye icon on hover.
